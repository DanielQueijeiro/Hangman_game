# Hangman
###### Background
Hangman is a pencil and paper guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it as suggested by letters or within a certain number of chances.
Using a row of dashes, the word to be guessed is represented, giving the number of letters. If the guessing player suggests a letter or number that appears in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the other player draws an element of the hanged stick man figure as a tally mark. The game ends when:
- The guessing player completes the word, or guesses the complete word correctly.
- The other player completes the drawing

The origin of this game is uncertain, but despite its little known past, it is one of the games that probably everyone knows and is familiar with.
It is a simple game to play and it is entertaining.

The goal of this project is to recreate this game through Python3 code so that the code gives a random word to the player and keeps track of the mistakes the player makes.

Introduction

    print("Welcome to Hangman by Daniel Queijeiro")

Selection of the random word and presenting it to the player.

The player starts guessing letters and the program informs him if he guesses right or wrong (slicing to show the correct letters?)

      
The guessing process is repeated 

     

The program detects when the word is complete and ends the game.

 

 The player has reached his error limit and loses.
